description: CafeSync is your own personal bulletin board. Whether you are a business,
  artist, musician, or any other person that needs to get noticed Cafesync aims to
  make it easier. By opening the application in any area that has public wifi you
  leave your "business card" for anyone else using CafeSync to pick up. There is a
  timed deletion for cards that you don't save so you don't have to worry about keeping
  your app clean of unwanted cards. For those that are saved you will never have to
  worry about calling a wrong number or getting an old address because the cards are
  updated automatically in the saved section of the app. Further more the most important
  information is saved locally so no need for an "always connected device" to get
  telephone numbers  to contact the card owner. We are still in the early days so
  if you download this app be sure to tell your friends and colleagues about it. As
  that will be the only way the service will really shine.
